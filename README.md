## What is this repository

This repository contains the scripts used in my PhD thesis for defect prediction analysis.

The scripts are fairly versatile and can be configured to run similar experiments with different
sets of metrics or different external models.

To read in detail about each step and how to approach reproduction of the results,
see `docs` directory.
